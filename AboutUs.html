              <h4>I am Hassan, and my journey at the Nasser Center for Science and Technology (NCST) began after I completed middle school. I was curious about future job opportunities and the skills required to secure them. Intrigued by the diverse courses offered at NCST, I decided to enroll but was initially unsure about which major to choose. My passion for building computers and coding led me to explore both engineering and IT during my first semester. This foundational experience helped me realize that artificial intelligence (AI) was the perfect blend of my interests, as it combines coding with the creation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, much like working with computers.
                <br>
                <br>
                At NCST, I am majoring in AI, where we delve into fascinating subjects like Machine Learning and Deep Learning. These courses have opened my eyes to the incredible potential of AI in transforming various industries. My favorite subject, however, is English. I thoroughly enjoy it, especially because of my favorite teacher, Mr. Scott, who makes learning engaging and fun. His classes have significantly improved my communication skills, which are essential in any field, including AI.
                <br>
                <br>
                The school itself offers a comprehensive curriculum that covers a wide range of subjects, ensuring that students receive a well-rounded education. The supportive environment at NCST has allowed me to enhance my skills in coding and robotics, providing me with hands-on experience that is invaluable for my future career. The faculty members are knowledgeable and always willing to help, making the learning experience both challenging and rewarding.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking ahead, I aim to attend a university that offers advanced courses in data science and artificial intelligence. My ultimate goal is to become a certified Artificial Intelligence Engineer, contributing to innovative projects that can make a significant impact on society. The journey at NCST has been instrumental in shaping my career path, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.</h4>

              <h4>

                As I approach the end of my grade 12 year, I find myself reflecting on my journey at NCST. I remember the nervousness I felt on my first day, stepping into an unfamiliar environment. However, I quickly adapted and discovered my passion for AI and robotics, which has since become a significant part of my life.
                <br>
                <br>
                My classmates and teachers have played an instrumental role in my growth. The supportive environment and innovative teaching methodologies have made learning both enjoyable and meaningful. The laughter, camaraderie, and positive experiences we shared are memories I will cherish forever.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I move towards the final stages of graduation, I am filled with excitement and anticipation for the future. The opportunities that await and the potential technological innovations I might create inspire me to continue pursuing my dreams with determination and enthusiasm. I am eager to see where this journey will take me and how I can contribute to the world of technology.

              <h4>I am Laith Alhaddad, my journey at NCST started when I completed middle school. I decided to search for jobs in the future and what certificates or skills does most of the jobs require for me to get employed. And then one of my friends told me that his brother goes to NCST which offers courses in different industries like engineering and information technology. After that I decided to get into the centre but didn't know what major to choose, the reason for that is because I like building computers and programming.
                <br>
                <br>
                So, in the first semester I got a foundation that taught me engineering and information technology and got more into IT than engineering and after that I got into artificial intelligence as it combines both coding and building internet of things devices which is almost the same as computers. After getting into AI, I started getting into different courses that enhanced my skills in coding and robotics.
                <br>
                <br>
                And now I am looking forward to get into a university that offers courses regarding data science and artificial intelligence, and after university I would like to become a certified Artificial Intelligence Engineer.</h4>

              <h4>My first time entering the school, I was extremely nervous, imagining high school students based on what I had seen in movies, such as emotionally unstable teens or seniors who always take risks and go out with friends. When I entered, I saw many people, some whose personalities were accurate to the movies, and some who had unique styles. After seeing many interesting people, I hoped to make new friends and interact with my teachers and colleagues, but it was not as easy as expected. The students in my year already had friends from their previous schools or the neighborhood, but the teachers were very supportive and made the school a great experience throughout the year. When the final exams got closer and closer, I was very shocked to see that there were two exams on each day, but I managed to pull through with excellent marks.
               <br>
               <br>
                In my sophomore year, I got a pretty good idea about how the school works and how to interact with students and teachers. I chose my major, which is Artificial Intelligence. I earned many certificates this year, including a Python programming competition and honorable student awards. This year was very smooth as I had spent a year with my colleagues and got very close with them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now I am in my senior year, having spent two years with my colleagues and made very good friends with them, which made the school very enjoyable. Now I have plenty of experience, which I gained from going to events and exhibitions with the school, giving a presentation at one of them. These experiences all help with preparing me for my on-the-job training. To prepare for on-the-job training and university, I am aiming to build my curriculum vitae (CV) by taking online courses, getting certificates, and studying for my SAT.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, my journey in NCST so far has been unique and amazing. I have enjoyed it a lot. From the experience I gained and the friends I made along the way, it has been an invaluable experience.</h4>

              <h4>The moment i started school, I was really suprised and happy because i have never been to a school like this before, but i was nervous because i thought this school is going to be hard, because my english was really bad and i didnt practice it before. When school started, I noticed that most of the teachers were speaking english and i wasnt used  to that because the school i went to before all the teachers speak arabic even the english teachers, so i had a hard time to try to understand whats the teacher saying, and whenever the teacher says something that i dont understand i just ask the people around me about whats the teacher saying. After beening able to catch some word from the teacher and my english was getting better, I started making new friends and interact with my teachers and colleagues, but of course not everthing was going well. I noticed that my grade are very going very down the hill because i was just coming back from the pandamic (covid-19), so my brain wasnt working as it should be working
                so i started to work harder on my grades and ptting up more time to study and trying to learn more english, and everything was improving even the teachers noticed it. after studing harder i noticed that iam really good at the IT classes so after finishing hte first year i picked AI(Artificial Intelligence) as my major, from that I earned many certificates this year, like a Python programming competition and honorable student awards. At this year everything was going all fine and everything was going great with the teachers and even the students.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally I am a senior now, after two years of studying hard and putting all my time to school just so i can make my family proud. i gained alot of experience from school, the people i met  and the events i went to, and now iam planning to finsih school and getting a certificte that will take me out of the country and study there.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the end, NCST is the best this ever happened to me in my life. life here was so fun. because of the people i met and friends I made, it has been an good experience.</h4>
