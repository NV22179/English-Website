            As an AI student at the Nasser Center for Science and Technology (NCST), I've seen firsthand how AI can significantly enhance my learning experience and help me achieve high marks. AI tools personalize my learning by analyzing my strengths and weaknesses, allowing me to focus on areas where I need improvement. This tailored approach makes my study process more efficient and effective. Interactive tools like virtual labs and simulations make learning engaging and practical, especially for complex topics like Machine Learning and Deep Learning. These tools help me visualize data and algorithms, deepening my understanding of the subject matter. AI apps also help me manage my time better by organizing my study schedule, setting reminders, and suggesting optimal study times based on my productivity patterns. This allows me to spend more time learning and less time on routine tasks. AI-driven search engines and recommendation systems provide quick access to a vast array of educational resources, ensuring I have everything I need to excel in my studies. Language learning tools powered by AI have significantly improved my English communication skills by offering personalized feedback on my writing and speaking. Real-time feedback on assignments helps me learn from my mistakes and continuously improve. AI also facilitates collaboration by connecting me with peers, mentors, and experts in the field, enriching my learning experience and opening up opportunities for future collaborations. Studying AI not only equips me with technical skills but also prepares me for a future job market with high demand for AI professionals. The skills I gain at NCST will be invaluable for my career. Overall, AI has transformed my education, enhancing my skills, improving my academic performance, and preparing me for a bright future.

          <h4>NV22132 - Jassim Mohammed</h4>

          <p>As a student at NCST,I began using AI because my friends mentioned it to me. Initially, I used it to find answers to my questions and to learn more about school subjects. AI turned out to be really helpful, especially when I was studying for exams, as it helped me review things more quickly by explaining them in a way that made sense to me. However, when I first started using AI, it wasn’t as advanced as it is now, and I sometimes encountered wrong information.
<br>
<br>
            Currently, I use ChatGPT for general questions Claude for its accuracy and speed, and NoteGPT to extract notes from YouTube videos, which helps me save time and manage my studies better. These tools have really helped boost my grades by making studying more effective. I’ve realized that AI is there to support me, not to do the work for me, so I use it for ideas and direction instead of just copying what it says. For instance, when I was working on the Pearson report, I turned to ChatGPT for some creative ideas to finish it quicker and make sure it was well-written. All in all, AI has been a fantastic help in my education, significantly changing how I learn and succeed.</p>

          <p>AI can make work easier for employees in many ways like it can handle tasks that make them bored, letting the workers focus on things that are more interesting. AI will help the employees make better decisions by analyzing data more quickly. It wil improve the customer service with chatbots that answer questions right away rather than making people wait in queue to ask an employee that could focus on fixing the mistake that the customer is having. In the learning area, AI creates personalized plans to help employees grow. It makes teamwork smoother by organizing communication and tasks between them. In general, AI makes work easier and faster by organizing tasks and helping employees manage their work with less stress. This will result in a more productive and pleasant workplace.</p>

          <p>NCST fighting deforestation and pollution.
            At NCST, we use a sustainable way of learning by conducting tests and assignments online through laptops or iPad’s instead of paper which piles up and ends up in the garbage. This change has a significant impact on the environment, imagine 500 students using more than 3 papers each every day that is many papers which costs many trees, trees are important for our environment by absorbing carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen, and maintain biodiversity.
             This helps preserve trees which are an essential resource, but it doesn’t end here, conducting online test and assignments lowers waste majorly as paper waste causes pollution which often ends up in landfills or being incinerated, which releases harmful chemicals in the air. This digital change cuts down significantly on this environmental impact.
            Using tech for assignments and test is more convenient as there is no need to worry about misplaced papers or running out of pages while everything is on one device. Using tech is not easy for everyone this could encourage them to learn and understand modern devices as digital work is the way for the future, while technical issues could arise and cause problems these issues could be solved with ease by an expert and the environmental benefits outweigh these minor inconveniences.
            By making this shift, NCST is not only helping the environment but setting an example for others to follow. This is important as this small change by one school could contribute to changes on a larger scale and cause a healthier planet.</p>
